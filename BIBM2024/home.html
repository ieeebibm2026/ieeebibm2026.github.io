<!-- 	<p><font size="3">The safety and well-being of all conference participants 
	is our priority. After evaluating the current COVID-19 situation and the 
	restriction of the international travel, the decision has been made to 
	transform the in-person component of IEEE BIBM 2022 into an all-digital 
	conference experience – IEEE BIBM 2022 will now be an online event. 
	Therefore, IEEE BIBM 2022 will no longer take place in Houston, TX, USA and 
	will instead take place virtually. The conference dates remain the same – 
	December 9-12, 2022. Proceedings will not be cancelled, and publications 
	will continue as planned.</font></p> -->
